    <H2>Background</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Eric and i'm a full time Moringa Prep student. Prior to this I worked in the banking industry for 6 years. I hold a Bsc. degree in Software Engineering from Kenyatta University and I have also done a project management course (PMP). I am a proud alumni (Old Cambrian) of Nairobi School </p>
    <H2>Why am I here?</H2>
      <p>To say the truth, i'm too smart for what I was doing at the bank. I ddid some soul searching and with a little consultation I decided that the time was right to jump out and pursue what I knew I could excel at and make a fantastic career out of</p>
