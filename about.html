    <h2>ERIC OCHIENG'</h2>
    <p>Howdy! The above picture is my adopted cat Tom, he started coming to the house around mid 2017 and once you feed them they never leave</p>
    <p>Here is a list of the few things i know about him</p>

    <p>He's male.</p>
    <p>He started off enjoying omena but once he tasted chicken bones and cat food he upgraded himself.</p>
    <p>He gets bullied by two other cats(okay, they're pretty big).</p>
    <p>He loves the indoors.</p>
    <p>He loves to rub himself against peoples legs.</p>
